aerscreen
=======


This package provides a dataframe based interface for performing _AERSCREEN_ runs from R. 



_AERSCREEN_ is an air dispersion screening model based on _AERMOD_. Through the use of protective assumptions for windspeed and land use parameters, _AERSCREEN_ is intended to produce concentration estimates that are equal to or greater than the estimates produced by _AERMOD_ with more developed sets of meteorological and terrain data.
