# Objective

Default dispersion factors used for screening purposes are updated after the release of a new AERMOD version or MET data set. The model versions^[AERMOD version: 15181] and meteorology^[Met years: 2009-2013; sites MSP & DYT] used for the current dispersion factors are shown on the right. The generated dispersion factors are designed to be protective and overestimate dispersion for real-world operating conditions. The conservative assumptions allow the results to be generalized to a wide set of operation scenarios and provide for quick estimates of air concentrations.

# Updates

The table of default dispersion factors was expanded to include the following options.


- Downwash efffects
- Minimum exit velocity
- Minimum stack temperature
- Minimum stack diameter

# Assumptions

1. __Downwash:__ Worst-case downwash parameters were captured for each scenario by including buildings located 50 meters from the facility in each of the 8 cardinal directions. Three building heights were modeled for each scenario: 50%, 75% and 100% of the stack height.   
1. __Meteorology:__ Each scenario was modeled with met data from `MSP` and `DUL`. 
1. __Stack temperature:__ A minimum stack temperature that is as warm as ambient conditions.  
1. __Exit velocity:__ A minimum exit velocity of 0.2 m/s.

  
_The screening dispersion factors are not considered protective for facilities with exit temperatures below ambient or for sources with near zero exit velocity._

5. __Receptor grid:__  
  > 2 meter spacing for receptors up to 50m from the facility  
  > 5 meter spacing for receptors up to 110m  
  > 10 meter spacing for receptors up to 200m  
  
5. __Flat terrain:__ The model was run with the `flat terrain` option.
5. __Rural:__ The model was run with the default  `rural` option.


# Alernatives

AERSCREEN uses a simple factor method to estimate annual average concentrations - divide the 1-hour maximum by ten. While this method is appropriate for nearby receptors, it results in overly protecive estimates for distances greater than 50 meters.



# Input files
An input file was created for each of the scenario combinations below. `r "672 scenarios were modeled in total."` There was a total of 168 different sources, each modeled using 2 sets of MET data with downwash both and and off.

  - Two met files: Minneapolis (MSP) and Duluth (DYT)   
  - 44 stack heights: [1 to 37 and 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90] meters    
  - 7 stack diameters: [0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5] meters    
  - 6 exit velocities: [0.2, 1, 3, 10, 20, 35] m/s  
  - 4 exit temperatures: [Ambient, 293, 315, 450] kelvin
  - 2: Downwash on/off
